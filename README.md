This app was created with the intention to help you learn the names of all the members in MDB!

You simply click start to begin, and there will be a transition over to the main screen of the app.

Afterwards you are presented immediately with an image of a current MDB member and 4 answer choices. 
Select which one you believe to be the person and the app will either turn the choice green or red depending on if its
right or wrong.

You have 5 seconds to answer, otherwise all answer choices will become red and move on.

The score will be incremented in the top left corner as you play the game.

If you select the stop button, you will be returned to the first screen.

If you click on the top right statistics icon, inside the navigation bar, you are brought to the following screen:

Here you are shown your longest streak of correct answers, and how you have done on the last three questions.
